<div><h2>About SLUG</h2>
  
<div><h3>Why are we here?</h3>
<p>SLUG is the Linux user group of Rutgers University. It was created
because there are currently no active Linux user groups accessible to
Rutgers students without a car. Our goal is to fill that void by
getting together with others who are also interested in Linux.</p></div>

<div><h3>Who should join SLUG?</h3>
  <p>SLUG is for any computing hobbyist on campus. We are nominally
    about Linux and as such have a strong focus on Linux and other
    Unix-like operating systems, but we welcome anyone who wants to
    learn more about computers in a relaxed, friendly environment. We
    promote the use and development of free and open-source software
    whenever possible. Common topics we discuss are programming,
    system administration, customization, hardware modification,
    collecting, and gaming.
