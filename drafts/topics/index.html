    <h1>Topics for Future Meetings</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>The topics that RU SLUG meetings are about should be simple
    enough to be adequately explained in under an hour to an audience
    that only has a general knowledge of its background unless a
    substantial amount of members show interest in it. Below is a list
    of suggestions for talks and workshops, but members and guests
    alike are allowed to propose presentations and workshops on
    different topics.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Beginner Topics</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Introduction to Package Management</h3>
      <p>At the heart of almost every Linux distribution is
      a <em>package manager</em>, a mean by which users can easily
      obtain software and data usually provided by the maintainers of
      the distribution. These centralized sources, in addition to the
      freedom to choose alternatives, are for some the largest draw to
      the Linux family of operating systems. The basic use of most of
      them are mostly quite similar, but some differences in the
      philosophies of the creators becomes apparent in some of the
      nuances of their operation.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Shell Scripting</h3>
      <p>Why do so many Linux tools seem so cryptic, and why do so
      many users insist upon using the command line above graphical
      tools? The belief is that by having less complex software, the
      system as a whole can be more robust by there being less space
      for bugs to weaken it and by tools not having to reimplement
      each other. Indeed, it made more sense to the creators of the
      Unix operating system, for which Linux can be considered an
      open-source heir to, to connect programs together to achieve a
      particular task. <em>Shell scripting</em> is the standard way to
      do this, and involves the sequential execution of several
      command-line programs as one larger program. programs. This is a
      critical skill to have for administrative tasks on any Unix-like
      system, and the skills discussed may even be transferable to
      operating systems not related to the Unix-like family, like
      Windows and VMS.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The <code>vi</code> and Vim Text Editors</h3>
      <p>The <code>vi</code> family of text editors are the most
      popular text editors in Linux and other Unix-like operating
      systems, being standard on most distributions and with some form
      of it required to be included if the operating system is to be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a>-compliant.
      While its plain user interface can seem unforgiving to new
      users, those familiar with the editor proclaim that its
      simplicity is a feature that makes both the user and the program
      itself more efficient.
      <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a>, short for "<tt>vi</tt>
      improved," is an iteration of <tt>vi</tt> with new features such
      as syntax highlighting and multi-file editing that can be
      configured via its built-in scripting language. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Version Control Systems</h3>
      <p>Almost every software project today is managed by
      a <em>version control system</em>, a piece of software that logs
      changes to a directory.
      Today, <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> is favored by
      developers the,
      but <a href="https://subversion.apache.org">Subversion</a> is a
      popular alternative
      and <a href="https://cvs.nongnu.org">Concurrent Version
      System</a> is used for much legacy open-source software. All of
      these enable anyone who needs to share a changing body of files
      to keep track of these changes in a standardized way and to have
      a standard protocol to have people other than the original
      creator contribute to a project. Sites such
      as <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
      and <a href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab</a> are popular
      centralized destinations to place one's own repositories, but
      repositories may be shared from any location.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Desktop Customization</h3>
      <p>There is a dizzying number of different graphical user
	interfaces available on free operating systems. While all aim
	to be as user-friendly as possible, each individual project
	has a different to creating something that its users will
	prefer to use. User interfaces on Linux are on spectrum from
	the
	highly-integrated <a href="https://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>
	and <a href="https://kde.org">KDE</a> that will be
	approachable for users of any experience, to more specialized
	user interfaces intended for advanced users.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Typesetting tools</h3>
      <p>Outside of what-you-see-is-what-you-get word processing
	software lies a rich set of tools for producing documents
	using only plain text. In mathematics, computer science, and
	physics, <a href="https://tug.org">TeX</a> is the single most
	common tool used to typeset papers, while
	<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>
	is quite common for personal use and for software
	documentation. Furthermore, plaintext typesetting tools may be
	used beyond documentation and articles, with the LaTeX
	"Beamer" class and the domain-specific
	language <a href="https://tikz.org">TiKZ</a> being
	specifically tailored for presentations and graphics
	alike.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>IEEE Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)</h3>
      <p>In the 1980s, the US government set to create a standard that
      computer operating systems would have to follow to be eligible
      for its use. A committee at IEEE quickly standardized around the
      popular
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_V_Unix">
	  System V Unix</a> as a base for the specification. While
      POSIX was not particularly successful in its goals for
      government contracts, it found new life as a standard that all
      Unix-like operating systems could use for portability between
      them.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Minimalist Software</h3>
      <p>Separate from the spiraling complexity of modern software,
      for which the Linux kernel and GNU project are not immune from,
      lies a community of elite programmers who explicitly want their
      software to do <em>less</em>. In exchange for the reduced
      number, users of minimalist software get increased performance,
      greater security, and the ability to reasonably maintain a
      personal fork of they software they use. The most notable par of
      this community is <a href="https://suckless.org">Suckless</a>,
      whose stated mission is to make software that "sucks less,"
      admitting that "all software sucks." Minimalism is also closely
      associated with the <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch
      Linux</a>, <a href="https://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>,
      <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, and
      <a href="https://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/">Plan 9</a> operating
      systems in their entirety.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Rust for Linux</h3>
      <p>Rust is an increasingly-popular systems programming that
      emphasizes memory safety. In 2022, the Linux kernel began to
      allow developers to submit code in Rust.
      Currently, <a href="https://asahilinux.org/about/">Asahi
      Linux</a> is the most popular distribution which uses this
      functionality, which is used in its case in the distribution's
      custom fork of the kernel to provide compatibility with the Apple
      Silicon series of systems on chips.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The X Window System</h3>
      <p>The X Windowing System is the standard graphical user
      interface protocol for Unix-like systems. As a server, it has
      functionalities beyond serving a single user: it may forward the
      graphical output of a program over an internet, as was common in
      many organizations that could not afford dedicated workstations.
      It may also be used on operating systems that are not Unix-like
      at all, also being the standard graphical user interface
      protocol on OpenVMS. Windows and macOS may also use X programs
      through various compatibility layers.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Wayland Protocol</h3>
      <p>X11 developers at Freedesktop.org saw the standard protocol
      as having inherent security flaws, such as the ability for a
      program to know the state of all others in the same X
      environment. Furthermore, looking to modernize the way users
      interact with their environments, then new Wayland protocol was
      designed to take advantage of hardware graphics acceleration
      universally present on modern PCs, tablets, and
      smartphones.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Î¼CLinux</h3>
      <p>Maintained fork of the Linux kernel designed to run on
      microcontrollers without a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit">memory
      management unit</a> (MMU). This is the most common way to get
      Linux-based operating systems on embedded devices like the Apple
      iPod or Nintendo DS, which do not have have MMUs.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>SELinux</h3>
      <p>Security-Enhanced Linux. It is the default kernel on the Red
      Hat family of distributions, which includes Red Hat Enterprise
      Linux, Fedora, and CentOS Stream.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Monolithic Kernels versus Microkernels</h3>
      <p>Perhaps the single largest choice an operating system
      designer can make is that between a monolithic kernel, which
      holds most the core functionality of the operating system within
      the kernel, or as a microkernel, which is as small as possible
      and has external software in userspace perform most of the
      operating system's duties. In the first year of the Linux
      kernel's development, this was a point in controversy: Andrew
      Tannenbaum, the creator
      of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix">Minix</a>,
      thought the monolithic kernel design was outdated even in 1991,
      while Linus Torvalds held to his opinion that a monolithic
      kernel was more practical in production. Some operating systems,
      such as macOS with
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNU">XNU kernel</a>
      and Windows with the NT kernel, try to bridge the gap between
      these two designs by having a microkernel and a core set of
      servers within kernel space.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>System Administration</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Package Management with Nix</h3>
      <p>Nix is a package manager that is configured by a functional
      programming language also called Nix and is the central draw
      to <a href="https://nixos.org">NixOS</a>, which is based around
      the package manager. It has gained substantial attention in the
      past few years because of its attention to reproducible builds,
      robustness, extensibility, and portability.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Virtual Machines</h3>
      <p>A virtual machine is a class of emulator that is expected to
      replicate all the functionalities and behavior of a physical
      machine in real time. They are particularly useful for testing
      and debugging system software and software that runs on an
      operating system not native to the host.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Containers</h3>
      <p>For developers and system administrators
      alike, <em>containers</em> provide a virtualized system to test
      and run specific programs outside of host operating system.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Choosing a Shell</h3>
      <p>There are several different shells, with each operating
      system seeming to have a different default. On just about every
      system, there exists a limited POSIX-compliant shell useful for
      basic tasks that require portability, but for interactive use,
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">BASH</a>, <a href="https://www.zsh.org">ZSH</a>,
      and <a href="https://fishshell.com/">FISH</a> are more common.
      Users of older systems may also be familiar with the Korn
      shell.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Single-board Computers</h3>
      <p>Slotting in price and ability below even most thin clients,
      these dimunitive computers have seen resounding success in
      educational, hobbyist, and embedded markets. Popular solutions
      include the
      <a href="https://raspberrypi.com">Raspberry Pi</a> and
      <a href="https://www.beagleboard.org">BeagleBoard</a> lines of
      devices. Due to their lightweight nature, they rarely run a
      proprietary desktop operating system like Windows, usually
      opting for Linux or a specialized real-time operating system
      (RTOS).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Securing a Unix System</h3>
      <p>In production and at home, system administrators have become
      increasingly aware of the security threats that a system may
      face when exposed to people inside and outside the organization
      it belongs to. There is a list of standard techniques and
      preferred solutions to mitigate security risks.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>PGP Encryption</h3>
      <p>Pretty Good Protection is a common standard for encryption on
      machines running a Unix-like operating system. GNU Privacy Guard
      is one implementation of it. In particular, this workshop or
      presentation should focus upon encrypting e-mail with it, and
	can be tied together with a potential keysharing event.</p>
      <p><em>A workshop was given by Mannan on February 9,
      2024.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Networked File Systems</h3>
      <p>Users increasingly want to access their data remotely. From
      the
      1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun
      Microsystems</a>, a vendor of Unix workstations, had created the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System">Network
      File System</a> standard for multiple devices to access the same
      storage over a network. For Windows and OS/2
      users, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Internet_File_System">Common
      Internet File System</a> (CIFS), formerly known as Server Message
      Block, is the standard protocol to access information over an
      internet. Due to their popularity, both have been implemented as
      servers within the mainline Linux kernel despite the security
      risks they may impose. Users of Unix-like operating systems may
      run <a href="https://www.samba.org">Samba</a> to use CIFS.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Compiling a Linux Kernel</h3>
      <p>For many users of Linux-based operating systems, recompiling
      one's own kernel is a rite of passage to becoming an advanced
      user. By understanding the features and options that the kernel
      has, users may enable functionality they need or disable
      functionality they do not need to save space and improve
      performance, especially during startup. On modern systems, the
      task of configuring and compiling a Linux kernel is not
      especially involved, but contains many options that may not seem
      especially clear even with the included documentation.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Writing Manual Pages</h3>
      <p>Documentation is often overlooked by developers, especially
      in fast-moving projects, but is the user's main way of
      understanding what a particular protocol or piece of software
      does. The on-line manual page format has been relatively
      standard and straightforward since its inception in the 1970s,
      and will be second nature to those familiar with
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/troff"><tt>troff</tt></a>
      typesetting utility.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Volume Managers</h3>
      <p>When computer systems grow large enough, they may include
      multiple hard drives. To increase performance, back up data, and
      create a seamless user experience, volume management software
      can make an operating system view multiple disks as a single
      large volume. On Linux-based
      systems, <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/lvm2/">Logical
      Volume Management</a> is common,
      while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS</a> is
      common on Linux, BSD, and Solaris operating systems, especially
      in enterprise use or in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a>
      installations.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Systemd</h3>
      <p>Most popular modern Linux distributions use the init system
	Systemd. It seeks to improve startup times, streamline system
	administration, and make running multiple instances of the
	same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemon</a>
	concurrently a simple task. Systemd is also the most
	controversial part of modern GNU/Linux systems. Seeking to do
	more than traditional init systems, it is seen as
	overly-complicated and difficult to maintain, and in general
	at odds with the principles that make the Unix-like family of
	operating systems attractive. Furthermore, Systemd is not a
	portable program due to its complicated nature and its heavy
	use of the Linux kernel API as opposed to POSIX, and may
	impose vendor lock-in to the GNU/Linux ecosystem by having
	popular software like GNOME need it as a dependency.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Non-Linux Operating Systems</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)</h3>
      <p>In the 1980s, the University of California, Berkeley gained
      access to the Unix source. Associates of the university modified
      the sources and distributed them under a special license that
      allowed people to distribute the software nearly without
      restriction. These modified sources later became foundational to
      several commercial Unix variants. In the late 1980s, a company
      looking to commercialize the product called BSDi was founded.
      Although the vast majority of the operating system was free
      software derived from the BSD project, six files relating to the
      networking code that originated from AT&amp;T were still present
      within their operating system's source code. AT&amp;T promptly
      sued BSDi, but the court ruled in favor of the startup's favor.
      This operating system, known as 386BSD, became the base for the
      subsequent free BSD projects which are active thirty years
      later, most
      notably <a href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="https://netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>,
      and <a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>. Darwin, the
      core of macOS, iOS, and iPad OS, also shares a substantial
      amount of code with FreeBSD, and the two projects frequently
	exchange code.</p>

    <div>
      <h3>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</h3>
      <p>As a replacement for the previous Windows NT "personality"
      that could run POSIX programs and Windows Services for Unix,
      Microsoft has bundled Linux compatibility into Windows starting
      with Windows 10. Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) uses a
      complete Linux kernel and has compatibility with graphical
      programs on the Windows API.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Plan 9 From Bell labs</h3>
      <p>Named for the cult classic Ed Wood film
	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052077/">Plan 9 From
	Outer Space</a>, this operating system was created by the
	original developers of Unix at Bell Labs as a continuation and
	evolution of the Unix philosophy â simplicity,
	maintainability, and "everything is a file" â while reducing
	the amount of work required to run distributed programs and
	graphical user interfaces. It is the origin of
	the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>
	standard and <a href="http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/5/intro">9P
	protocol</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Unix Workstations</h3>
      <p>Before GNU/Linux became the most popular Unix-like operating
      system for software development, servers, and scientific
      computing, and before the Personal Computer platform was seen as
      capable enough for these applications, vendors of specialized
      high-end personal computers each offered their own variant of
      Unix, usually based on Version 7 Unix, System V Unix, or BSD.
      They also often had specialized microprocessors,
      like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ISA">POWER</a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">PowerPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA-RISC">PA-RISC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha">Alpha</a>,
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium">Itanium</a>.
      While this class of hardware was largely rendered redundant by
      64-bit x86 workstations, the software that ran on them survives
      in the form
      of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/aix">AIX</a> from
      IBM, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers/hp-ux.html">HP-UX</a>
      from HP, <a href="https://www.oracle.com/solaris">Solaris</a>
      from Oracle (formerly by Sun),

    <h2>Social Issues in Computing</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Free Software Licenses</h3>
      <p>In the past decade, releasing one's own software as
       open-source has become the standard method of distribution.
       Most people who release open-source software prefer to give a
       higher degree of freedom to the software's users: they may
       choose a free software license that enables this. Choosing
       between the myriad ready-to-use licenses or writing a new
       license is a point of concern for many developers who may not
       understand the rights they are or are not granting their
       software's users.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>The Intel Management Engine and Free BIOSes</h3>
      <p>The BIOS (basic input/output system) is the last piece of
      common computer software that does not have a standard free
      implementation. The Intel Management engine is a small CPU core
      present on the motherboard's chipset that currently has an
      unknown purpose, but runs a fully-featured multitasking
      operating system and has complete access to the computer's
      hardware, including the memory, disks, and network interfaces. A
      common goal of free BIOS projects is to disable this device. Two
      of the most popular and successful projects for the PC platform
      are <a href="https://coreboot.org">Coreboot</a> and
      <a href="https://libreboot.org">Libreboot</a>, with the latter
      being a fork of the former without
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_blob">binary
      blobs</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Big Tech and Free Software</h3>
    <p>Free software has become increasingly preferred by developers
      as it guarantees rights for themselves and their users. Despite
      its legal nonprofit status, the
      <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>
      can be considered a commercial entity, emphasizing its corporate
      members such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services.
      Their contributions to the free software ecosystem can be
      considered beneficial to projects themselves, but free software
      advocates are concerned that these large companies are using
      free software out of economic incentive rather than as a more
      ethical method of distribution of their products. Permissive
      licenses such as
      <a href="https://opensource.org/license/bsd-2-clause/">BSD</a>
      and <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit/">MIT</a> have
      been similarly divisive because they do not require the parties
      which modify the source code to publicly publish their
      changes, leading to situations where large projects do not
