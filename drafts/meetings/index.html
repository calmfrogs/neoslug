  <h2>Spring 2024</h2>

  <h3>January 26, 2024 Meeting</h3>
  <p>This was a mostly administrative meeting concerning how meetings
  are to be held for the rest of the semester. As we had recently
  acquired funding under our provisional status, much of our
  discussion oriented towards allocating our funds towards potential
  meetings. As a result, we then focused on creating a plan to create
  a schedule, recruit new members, and find volunteers to host
  meetings.</p>
